### Stacks & Queues

#### Stack
- ADT with following operationS:
  - Push - adds to collection
  - Top - returns most recently-added
  - Pop - removes most recently-added
  - Empty - are there any elements

- We can implement a stack with an array or linked list
- Each stack operation is O(1)
- Known to follow LIFO queues; Last In First Out

#### Queue
- ADT with the following operations:
  - Enqueue - adds to collection
  - Dequeue - removes least recently-added
  - Empty? - are there any elements

- First-In, First-Out / First Come, First Serve
- Also O(n) operations
- When doing an array implementation of a fixed size, we can use a circular buffer to keep track of where our enqueue de dequeue positions are
- Some languages allow you to do a priority queue; elements have a priority and move to the front of the queue if they have a higher priority

- Deque : A double-ended queue
  - can behave like a stack or a queue; we can add items to either end of this ADT and remove from either end as well
