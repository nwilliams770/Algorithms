### Hash Table

- Maintain a set of items, each with a key, essentially a DICTIONARY
- Can:
  - insert
  - delete
  - search

- Chaining: store a List of colliding elements in each slot of hash table
- Simple uniform hashing: Each key is equally likely to be hashed to any slot of the table
independent of where other keys hashing.

- Arrays have FIXED SPACE; therefore, the hash function allows us to condolidate a bunch of different elements into a limited
number of slots; common practice is to use a HASH function
- Most common way of hashing is to do K % M where K is the el and M is the length of data 
structure
