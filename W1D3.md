### Binary Search
- Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items. It works by repeatedly dividing in half the portion of the list that could contain the item, until you've narrowed down the possible locations to just one. 

## Graph Search 
- Applications: web crawling, social networking, network broadcast, garbage collection, model checking


Graph Representation:
 One standard representation Adjaceny List: 
 - array Adj
 - each el is a pointer to a linked list
 - indexed by a vertex; store neighnbors of each vertex
 
 You can represent a graph in an object-oriented way, 
 say for example vertex.neighbors = Adj[v]; but is best for one graph because we can't easily recycle vertexes

 ### BFS -- for directed and undirect graphss
 - visit all nodes reachable from given node
 - look at nodes reachable in one move, two moves
 - careful to avoid duplicates



### DFS 
- visit all vertices and visit every vertex only ONCE
- recursively explore graph, backtracking as necessary
- by creating a stack of visit vertexes, we can classify an edge based on the vertex it points to (e.g. is the vertex it's pointing to already in the stack?)
- edge classification : 
  these are all relative to what we classify as the "root"
  - tree edge: (parent pointer) visit a new vertex via that edge
  - forward edge: node to descendant
  - backward edge: node to ancestor
  - cross edge: between 2 non-ancestor-related nodes goes from one tree to another (this assumes that there are multiple connections of nodes, that cannot be traversed together without the cross-edge)

- undirected graph can only have a tree edge and backward edge
- classified edges are important for cycle detection!
  - G has cycle, if in doing DFS, that graph has a backward edge

  ### Topological Sort
  - Given a DIRECTED ACYCLIC graph, order vertices so that all edges point from lower order to higher order

  - Topological sort: run DFS, output reverse of finishing times (finishing times as in when it's returned and popped off the recursive stack) of vertices. but why tho?
    - because our graph is acyclic, we will not have any backward edges therefore we will be recursively visiting nodes by order
